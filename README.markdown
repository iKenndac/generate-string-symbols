## What is it? ##

`generate-string-symbols` is a tiny little Mac command-line tool that creates a
header file containing `NSString` constants for the keys in the given `.strings`
files. Combined with a custom build step in your Xcode project and a bit of macro
magic, it can be used to automatically give compile-time checked keys for your
localised strings.

You can find a discussion on this over on [my blog](http://ikennd.ac/blog/2014/08/nslocalizedstring/).

## License ##

`generate-string-symbols` is licensed under three-clause BSD. The license document can be
found [here](https://github.com/iKenndac/generate-string-symbols/blob/master/LICENSE.markdown).

## Building ##

1. Clone create-ram-disk using `$ git clone git://github.com/iKenndac/generate-string-symbols.git`.
2. Open the project and build away!

## Usage ##

`$ generate-string-symbols -strings <path to .strings file> -out <output path>`

  * `-strings`  The path to a valid .strings file.

  * `-out` The path to write the output header file to. Missing
    directories will be created along the way. If a file
    already exists at the given path, it will be
    overwritten.

## Example ##

Given a strings file like this:

```
"OKTitle" = "OK";
"CancelTitle" = "Cancel";
"DownloadingTitle" = "Downloadingâ€¦";
```

This tool will output a header file like this:

```objc
// Generated by generate-string-symbols on 2014-08-10 13:08:47 +02:00
// Source file: /Users/dkennett/Projects/Cascable/Cascable/Base.lproj/GeneralUI.strings
// WARNING: This file was auto-generated. Do not modify by hand.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

static NSString * const OKTitle = @"OKTitle";
static NSString * const CancelTitle = @"CancelTitle";
static NSString * const DownloadingTitle = @"DownloadingTitle";
```

Note that key order isn't guaranteed.
